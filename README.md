These are some basic tests for localStorage and Sqlite implementations.

They are intended to be run on a phone, but you can also of course run them on a desktop browser.

The tests were part of some [research I did in 2010](http://jensarps.de/2010/09/07/storage-research-your-help-is-needed/), but they are still useful today.

What is tested?
===

There are two tests for localStorage, one tests the maximum storage size, and the other one tests the implementation's spec compliance for storage events.

And there are two tests for Sqlite, one for the maximum storage size, and the other one for the maximum field size of a single entry.

How to run?
===

Just point your browser to [jensarps.github.com/storageTests](http://jensarps.github.com/storageTests) and follow the instructions.

What about the results?
===

I'm still interested in any results and appreciate your efforts! If you want to submit the results, just include  your phone's OS and version, and also some info about the browser if it's not the one shipped with the OS, and mail it to me. Thanks in advance!
